# Yahtzee
Implementation of the board game Yahtzee in Java and JavaFX

### How to build:

To run the program with gradle, make sure your IntelliJ configuration looks like this. The important thing being the 'run' inside the tasks field.

Executing gradle on Yahtzee without `run` will simply build the project without launching it.


### How to build without IntelliJ:

If you would like to compile without IntelliJ, the command
```
gradlew run
```
can be executed in the project folder to build and launch the application.

The command `gradlew` can also be used on its own to build the program without running it.
